# Star Trek: Fleet Command's Data

Just a collection of __JSON__ formatted Star Trek: Fleet Command data
Eventually I plan on adding some code to merge all JSON files into one massive file and/or convert to a SQLite database for usage in developement.

Files prefixed with a z (e.g. zofficer-template.json) are meant to sink to the bottom and offer a useful template for new officers.
Each GUID for each officer, ship, system, etc should be unique.

Update: 2021.03.23: I have not forgotten about this. Working on a project to help making these files faster instead of having to format them by hand and memorize all the tags and such
