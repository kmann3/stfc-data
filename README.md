# Star Trek: Fleet Command's Data

Just a collection of __JSON__ formatted Star Trek: Fleet Command data
Eventually I plan on adding some code to merge all JSON files into one massive file and/or convert to a SQLite database for usage in developement.

Files prefixed with a z (e.g. zofficer-template.json) are meant to sink to the bottom and offer a useful template for new officers.
Each GUID for each officer, ship, system, etc should be unique.

Should you find yourself bored and so inclined...
I could use help with some simple stuff.
* Pictures (e.g. images/officers/OneOfTen.png) -- filling that out would be a great help. Empty.png in the filename means that it's not been done.
