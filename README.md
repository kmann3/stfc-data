# Star Trek: Fleet Command's Data

Just a collection of __JSON__ formatted Star Trek: Fleet Command data

Files prefixed with a z (e.g. zofficer-template.json) are meant to sink to the bottom and offer a useful template for new officers.

Went to normal int based ID's. Not convinced GUID's are better yet.

* Any items with a z in them such as officer-z-TLaan.json are INCOMPLETE. This is formatted in such a way that the incomplete ones sink below completed ones.

End goal here is to migrate them to a SQLite database as well as a SQL Server database and appropriate scripts for such.

A website to search for tags, save builds, etc is also in the works here. Formats and such will be open so it can be shareable and easily processed should anyone else decide they want to write their own API with the data.
